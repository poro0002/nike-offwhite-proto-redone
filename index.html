From a deconstructed Air Presto to an exaggerated Blazer Mid, Abloh’s signatures included “GHOSTING,” utilizing transparent uppers to unite the 10 silhouettes through common material and “REVEALING,” to expose a sneaker's inner workings through reconstruction. </p>

                    <p class="about__para">The company was first founded as "PYREX VISION" by Virgil Abloh in the Italian city of Milan in 2012.[2] Abloh then rebranded the company as Off-White in 2013, which he described as "the grey area between black and white as the color off-white" to the fashion world.[4] It has shown collections at Paris Fashion Week shows, and is sold in retail stores in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Milan, London, United Kingdom and New York.[4] In Fall 2016, and Winter 2017, the company collaborated with Levi's main line, Made & Crafted, and released twelve pieces, six of which were unisex.[3]
                        In early 2017, the company collaborated with Nike and worked on a project named "The Ten", which is a sneaker collection featuring Air Jordans, Converse, Nike Air Max, Nike Air Force One, and Nike Blazers shoes.[13] The collaborations shoe line was divided into two categories, the "Revealing" and "Ghosting".[14][15] The Off-White and Nike designers had an updated take on Nineties-style shoes, with various patterns and different types of material such as plastic and tulle.[3]
                        In 2017, the company collaborated with Champion developing sixteen items of clothing, including tracksuits, hoodies, fleeces, and t-shirts.[3] In August 2017, the company also collaborated with ASAP Rocky with his label AWGE.[16] In 2018, the company partnered with Jimmy Choo to create a Summer/Spring collection inspired by Lady Diana, former Princess of Wales.[3]
                        In April 2018, the company collaborated with IKEA on furniture targeted towards millennials.[17] In Fall 2018 and Winter 2019, the company collaborated with Sunglass Hut on a unisex line of sunglasses called "For Your Eyes Only".[3] In March 2019, the company collaborated with SSENSE on a range of workout clothes.[18] On June 5, 2018, the company released its collaboration with Rimowa, a transparent suitcase in limited edition.[19] Following the success of the collaboration, a second collection including two RIMOWA x Off-White transparent suitcases (a white version and a black version) is launched in October 2018.[20]

                    <p class="about__para">Barrier-breaking designer. Genre-bending artist. Visionary. These are some of the ways people have described Virgil Abloh after it was announced that the 41-year-old creative died on Sunday following a private two-year battle with cancer. Over the last decade, the prolific designer — the founder of streetwear label Off-White and Louis Vuitton's men's artistic designer — produced no shortage of memorable designs, ranging from Off-White's “Little Black Dress” (that was displayed at the Costume Institute 2020 “About Time” exhibit) to sought-after collaborations with everyone from artist Takashi Murakami to brand giants like Ikea, Evian, and Nike.
                        But unlike most other designers that have reached similarly dizzying levels of cultural success, Abloh always viewed his place in fashion as closer to the earth. Maybe because, regardless of the numerous accolades, he never stopped thinking of himself as an outsider — a “skater kid” from Chicago, an architect who didn't go to fashion school, a DJ, a Black designer working in luxury fashion. What comes to mind for me right now, is the “You're Obviously In The Wrong Place” installation that I saw at Abloh's retrospective at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art in the summer of 2019. This, I imagine, is a phrase that Abloh heard often on his ascent to the highest echelons of the industry, one that influenced his career's trajectory.
